# Memory Game

This project was build with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can use the same commands to run it.
The game is a simple memory game where you have to click on the cards to find the pairs. The game ends when you find all the pairs.

## How to run the game

To run the game you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). After you have installed both, you can run the following commands in the project directory:

### `yarn install`

This command will install all the dependencies needed to run the game.

### `yarn start`

This command will start the game in development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
